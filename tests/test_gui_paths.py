"""Path-resolution guards for the Streamlit GUI.

These tests exist because two shipped defects came from path handling that only
broke on a platform or Python version CI did not test:

- **G-010** — ``Path(__file__)`` is *relative* when Streamlit invokes the entry
  script, so ``Path(__file__).parent / "pages"`` produced a relative path that
  ``st.Page()`` could not stat. Reported by a student on macOS / Python 3.9.
  The fix was ``.resolve()``; these tests assert it stays.

- **A-09** — runtime assets were resolved relative to the *repository root*, so a
  pip-installed GUI came up with no logo, no branding, no example data and an
  empty gallery. Every ``.exists()`` guard in ``Home.py`` meant this failed
  silently. These tests assert the assets are inside the package and present.

Both checks are OS- and version-independent, which is the point: they hold on
every matrix cell rather than only on the one where the bug happened to show.
