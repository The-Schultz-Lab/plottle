"""Guards against documented counts drifting away from the code.

Audit finding A-25: "26 plot types" was stated in eight places across
``README.md``, ``docs/index.html``, ``Home.py`` and the Help page while
``PLOT_TYPES`` actually held 27 entries. ``inset_plot`` had been added without
anyone updating the prose, and nothing could catch it.

Rather than assert a hardcoded 27 -- which would just move the drift one level
out -- these tests derive the number from ``PLOT_TYPES`` and check that the
documentation agrees with it. Adding a plot type and forgetting the docs fails
here; adding one and updating the docs passes with no test change.
